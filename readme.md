- hook into class timetables
- hook into bus timetables
- hook into parking lot info
- aggregate parking data for a few weeks to predict trends
- hook into pushbullet
- suggest ride shares: offer or request cars new you

Keeps a track of your classes and calculates which bus / parking lot you 
should use to get there on time... can deliver push notifications to 
your phone to remind you. UI is just a list of events: take X bus, go to 
class, go to class, take X bus.
